üß† Zone-wise Real-Time People Detection & Occupancy Dashboard
A real-time computer vision dashboard built with YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Streamlit to detect people in live video streams or offline videos, divide the frame into four zones, and calculate zone-specific headcount, occupancy %, area occupied %, and status. Ideal for monitoring crowd density, social distancing, or managing room capacities.

üì∏ Features
‚úÖ YOLOv8-powered Person Detection

‚úÖ Real-time or offline video feed support (webcam or uploaded file)

‚úÖ Automatic zone detection (frame divided into 4 equal quadrants)

‚úÖ Zone-wise:

üî¢ Headcount

üìä Occupancy %

üü´ Area Occupied %

üü¢ Status (Underutilized, Nearly Full, Overcrowded, etc.)

‚úÖ Live analytics table

‚úÖ Custom alerts for:

üö® Overcrowding (when people > 10)

‚ö†Ô∏è Low activity (people < 2)

üìê Zone Calculations
Each frame is split into 4 equal zones:

Metric	Formula Description
Headcount	Count of detected persons per zone
Occupancy %	(Headcount / Zone Capacity) * 100
Area Occupied	(Sum of bounding box areas for people / Zone area) * 100
Status	Logic based on thresholds for occupancy and area (%): e.g., Underutilized, Full

üõ† Tech Stack
Tech	Purpose
YOLOv8	Object detection (person)
OpenCV	Video processing
Streamlit	Interactive dashboard
NumPy	Mathematical computations
Pillow	Image rendering

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
or individually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit opencv-python ultralytics pillow
2. Run the app
bash

‚ö†Ô∏è If streamlit is not recognized, try:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
3. Choose Video Source
üì∑ Webcam

üìÅ Upload a local video file (MP4, AVI, etc.)

üìä Example Analytics Table
Zone	Capacity	Headcount	Occupancy %	Area Occupied %	Status
Zone 1	10	9	90%	72%	Nearly full
Zone 2	10	2	20%	12%	Underutilized
Zone 3	10	11	110%	95%	Overcrowded
Zone 4	10	4	40%	38%	Moderate
